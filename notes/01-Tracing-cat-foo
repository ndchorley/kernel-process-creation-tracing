- Ran this on my openSUSE machine, running 5.14.21-150400.24.88, with
  kernel sources present.

- __x64_sys_execve seems to be the entry point for the system call,
  but it was hard to find where that function actually lives.

- The trace shows it calls do_execveat_common.isra.42 - not sure what
  isra.42 is about, but do_execveat_common at least lives in fs/exec.c.

- do_execveat_common seems to:
    - allocate and initialise a linux_bprm structure on the heap,
    - do some validation of number of command line arguments and (I guess)
      environment variables less than some max,
    - copy arguments and environment variable strings to the new process'
      stack (copy_strings) and
    - call bprm_execve to start executing the program.
